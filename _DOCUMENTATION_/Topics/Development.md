# Development

Run `npm run dev` to watch and build the `src` directory to `dist` (Extract GSheet script) and will build the `11ty-site` directory to `docs`. This will hot reload the 11ty documentation site.

## Testing the `dist` Output

If you need to test out the output script in `dist` go to `/test` in the development server.
