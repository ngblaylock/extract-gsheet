# Project Overview - Extract GSheet

This project was conceptualized when [Tabletop by jsoma](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) was discontinued. I liked using it for some small projects, and it really helped me learn Vue since there was a "database" I could pull from. It worked well, until it didn't. I ran a few tests and realized that I could do the same thing. I only have one personal use for it, and it is on the family website to display a YouTube-like preview of family videos. The google sheet it pulls from isn't an ideal format to find videos.

I published it originally as [extract-gsheet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extract-gsheet) and later switched to [@ngblaylock/extract-gsheet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngblaylock/extract-gsheet).

## Objectives

1. Easily get Google Sheet data as JSON without an API key
2. Provide read-only, public data
3. Have an NPM project that I can maintain for experience
